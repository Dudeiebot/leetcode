### Group Anagram
- Initialize a map where the key is an array of 26 integers (one for each letter) and the value is a slice of strings (the group of anagrams)
- range through the strings
- Initialize an array of 26 integers to count the frequency of each character in the string. so therefore k = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0...........0] for intialization.
- range through each character in the string
- Update the frequency count for the character in the array, so for example if char = e then k[e-a]  a = 0 and e = 4 our int calculation, so k[4] will be incremented from 0to 1, therefore k = [0,0,0,0,1,0,0........0] and we check for each character in the string like that till we are done with the string
- Use the character frequency array as a key in the map and append the string to the corresponding group. after done with each string, we make k the key of our map and the string the value as intitalized. like this hmap[[26]int{1, 0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 1, 0, 0}] = ["eat"]. we do that for all the word in the array string
- we have intialized a slice that holds our result
- Iterate over the map and append each group of anagrams to the result slice and remember each key in a hashmap must be unique, if you try to insert a key that already exists in the map, the new value will overwrite the existing value for that key. so we assign each value to a slice
