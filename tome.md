Just tome.md for my all everything into


So here basically we have the algorithm for leetcode and some explainantion following them



- Duplicate Number (we use map to get things done here or some len shii by ranging twice but memeory shii can come in)
- Valid anagram (we use map also and performs increment on it, then we range through the key and value of the increment)
- Valid palindrome (a very kind of strange lens calculation that goes through the string)
- Single number apperance (Using the bitwise operator will give us the constant time and space needed and very fast also, the bitwise operator here have a kind of calculation in it and it ir represented with the (^) symbol)
- Two Sums in a array and returning the indices of the nos, here we can use brute force which result to O(n2) and also we can use our hashmap to solve it which will make it faster and help save time O(n)
- Finding the nos palindrome using the equation half = half * 10 + x % 10, and then remember it is a loop, so it get to go through all till x > half then we check for the equality in the palindrome or if it is an odd nos we check for the mod with the equality
