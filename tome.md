So here basically we have the algorith for leetcode and some explainantion following them

- Duplicate Number (we use map to get things done here or some len shii by ranging twice but memeory shii can come in)
- Valid anagram (we us map aalso and performs increment on it then we range through the key and value of the increment)
- Valid palindrome (a very kind of strange lens calculation that goes through the string)
- Single number apperance
